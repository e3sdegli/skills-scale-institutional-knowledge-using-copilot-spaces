# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This README provides a brief overview of OctoAcme's project management processes and links to detailed process documents stored in this docs/ folder. It serves as the central index to help onboard new team members and make institutional knowledge discoverable and repeatable.

## OctoAcme Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme follows a lightweight, repeatable project management approach that emphasizes clarity, collaboration, and continuous improvement:

- Initiation: Define clear objectives, success criteria, and stakeholders at project start. New work is proposed via issues that include goals, scope, and acceptance criteria.
- Planning: Use short planning cycles to break work into well-scoped tasks, assign owners, estimate effort, and identify dependencies and risks.
- Execution and Tracking: Track progress via issues and project boards; use regular standups and status updates to keep stakeholders informed. Metrics and milestones guide progress reviews.
- Risk and Communication: Identify risks early, document mitigations, and maintain transparent communication channels (issues, PRs, and designated Slack/Teams channels).
- Release and Deployment: Maintain checklist-driven release processes, including feature flags or staged rollouts where appropriate, and clear rollback plans.
- Retrospective and Continuous Improvement: After milestones or releases, conduct retrospectives to capture lessons learned and update processes.
- Roles and Responsibilities: Define roles (e.g., Product Owner, Engineering Lead, Maintainer, QA) with clear responsibilities for decision-making, reviews, and approvals.

These processes are intentionally light-touch to support agility while ensuring consistency and institutional memory.
